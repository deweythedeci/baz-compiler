This file is for documenting the compiler's design.

This compiler is incredibly simple and largely sacrifices performance.
The compiler performs no optimization on the source code.

The compilations is done in 
1. Scanning
2. Parsing
3. AST generation
4. Error checking
5. CFG generation
6. Assembly generation
7. Binary generation

Scanning and parsing is done using ANTLR
Binary generation is done using GCC Assembler
