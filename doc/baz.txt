This file is for documenting the language's design.

Baz is a "toy" language in the sense that it is intended to be functional but not practical.

The syntax of Baz is intended to be statement based. Every line of code is terminated with a semicolon.
Blocks are implemented as a start statement and an end statement. This extends to function and class defintions.
Otherwise, the language is mostly C-like.

Baz is statically-typed and statically-allocated. This means the type and size of variables cannot be altered.
Baz uses pass-by-value for primitives and pass-by-reference for non-primitives. The primitive data types
are bool, int, char, and float.
